# VotingApp

This project aims to allow you build your very first dApp over the Ethereum blockchain. The dApp consists in a voting system. You will become familiar with the ethereum developement ecosystem, using tools such as [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org), [Metamask](https://metamask.io), [Ganache](https://truffleframework.com/ganache) and [Web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/). In addition, you will use Angular for building your client app.

## Prepare your development environment

In order to follow the instructions given during the practice, please download and install the following packages:

- DockStation (https://dockstation.io/)
- Metamask Chrome Extension (https://metamask.io/)

## Run the containers

Run `docker-compose up --build` to pull the images from docker registry. If this is the first time downloading the images, the operation might take a while. Once the download finishes, then containers will be initialized. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` to see the app.
